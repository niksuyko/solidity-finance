This is a snippet from a coin project I worked on. For reference, parts of this code are taken from user-created coin projects posted on BSCscan. The transaction security function was designed by me and a developer I met a couple years back while starting the project. I created about 10 of these projects, each with different use purposes and unique aspects to them.
