This is a snippet from a coin project I worked on. For reference, parts of this code are taken from user-created coin projects posted on BSCscan. T̶h̶e̶ t̶r̶a̶n̶s̶a̶c̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ s̶e̶c̶u̶r̶i̶t̶y̶ f̶u̶n̶c̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ w̶a̶s̶ d̶e̶s̶i̶g̶n̶e̶d̶ b̶y̶ m̶e̶ a̶n̶d̶ a̶ d̶e̶v̶e̶l̶o̶p̶e̶r̶ I̶ m̶e̶t̶ a̶ c̶o̶u̶p̶l̶e̶ y̶e̶a̶r̶s̶ b̶a̶c̶k̶ w̶h̶i̶l̶e̶ s̶t̶a̶r̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ t̶h̶e̶ p̶r̶o̶j̶e̶c̶t̶. I created about 10 of these projects, each with different use purposes and unique aspects to them.


EDIT 2/5/24: uploaded wrong code snippet - this is an older project of mine that does not seem to have the security functionality implemented. Currently trying to find the right project, will update when found.
