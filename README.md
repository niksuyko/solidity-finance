This is a snippet from a coin project I worked on. 

Disclaimer - a majority of this code was not solely created by me. Each coin took from a 'template' format, and I repurposed each coin with unique functions based on project goals and desires. I created about 10 of these projects, each with different use purposes and unique aspects to them.

A majority of the project's management was done via bscscan.com and it's interface. My community was created through Discord and consisted of ~200 members in its final state before dissolving due to a lack of steam in the BSC community, as well as eventually no longer turning a profit.
